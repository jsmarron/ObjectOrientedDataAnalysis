# ObjectOrientedDataAnalysis
Companion website for Object Oriented Data Analysis book by Marron &amp; Dryden

Object Oriented Data Analysis is a framework that facilitates inter-disciplinary research through new terminology for discussing the often many possible approaches to the analysis of complex data. Such data are naturally arising in a wide variety of areas. This book aims to provide ways of thinking that enable the making of sensible choices. 

The main points are illustrated with many real data examples, based on the authors' personal experiences, which have motivated the invention of a wide array of analytic methods. 

While the mathematics go far beyond the usual in statistics (including differential geometry and even topology), the book is aimed at accessibility by graduate students. There is deliberate focus on ideas over mathematical formulas. 



Key words or phrases:  Complex Data, Functional Data, High Dimensional Data, Manifold Statistics, Modes of Variation, Multivariate Statistics.
