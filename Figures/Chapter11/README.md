This directory contains graphics and code for reproducing figures in Chapter 11

Additional Notes:

The data set ShiftedCorrelatedGaussiansData.xlsx is created in OODAfig11p1.m, to be read by other programs using this data.

The data set DonutData.xlsx is created in OODAfig11p6.m, to be read by other programs using this data.

The data set CheckerboardData.xlsx is created in OODAfig11p7.m, to be read by other programs using this data.

The data set FourClusterData.xlsx is created in OODAfig11p8.m, to be read by other programs using this data.  Uses lines provided by Bernhard Scho"lkopf

The t-SNE analysis in OODAfig11p8.m uses the Matlab t-SNE software of Laurens van der Maaten, 2010.  Must be in the Matlab path.
