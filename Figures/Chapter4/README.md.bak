# ObjectOrientedDataAnalysis: Figures, Chapter 4
This directory contains graphics and code for reproducing figures in Chapter 4.

Additional Notes:

Figure 4.1 is created as the top row in the file OODAfig4p1A.png and the remaining rows in OODAfig4p1B.png.  The additional OODAfig4p1C.png shows the full output of a curvdatSM analysis, for obtaining the sums of squares given in the discussion.  

The data set TiltedParabolasData.xlsx is also created in OODAfig4p1.m, to be read by other programs using this data.  It is used in OODAfig4p2.m.  An outlier is added to the data set to create ParabolasAndOutlierData.xlsx by OODAfig16p2.m.

Figure 4.2 is also created as the top row in the file OODAfig4p2A.png and the remaining rows in OODAfig4p2B.png.

The data set TwinArchesData.xlsx is created in OODAfig4p3.m, to be read by other programs using this data.  It is used in OODAfig6p9.m - OODAfig6p12.m.

The data set LungCancerData.xlsx is created in OODAfig4p5.m, to be read by other programs using this data.  It is used in OODAfig4p6.m - OODAfig4p8.m, OODAfig6p13.m and OODAfig13p11.m - OODAfig13p12.m.

The data set PanCancerData.xlsx was copied from OODAbookChpBFigQdata.xlsx in OODAbook\ChapterB.  It is used in OODAfig3p5.m, OODAfig4p9.m - OODAfig4p11.m, OODAfig11p13.m, OODAfig13p3.m, OODAfig13p8.m - OODAfig13p9.m and OODAfig15p5.m - OODAfig15p6.m.

The data set OverlappingClassesData.xlsx is created in OODAfig4p12.m, to be read by other programs using this data.  It is used in OODAfig4p13.m
