# ObjectOrientedDataAnalysis: Figures, Chapter 5
This directory contains graphics and code for reproducing figures in Chapter 5.

Additional Notes:

Drug Discovery Data set analyzed in Figures 5.3 - 5.12 & 5.15 came from the Alexander Tropsha Lab.  The data set was called 'skin_data_all_withH.xlsx' in analyses by Petro Borysov.

The data set TwoScaleCurvesData.xlsx is created in OODAfig5p13.m, to be read by other programs using this data.

Figure 5.13 is created as the top row in the file OODAfig5p13A.png and the remaining rows in OODAfig5p13B.png.  The additional OODAfig5p13C.png shows the full output of a curvdatSM analysis, for obtaining the sums of squares given in the discussion.  

Figure 5.14 is created as the top row in the file OODAfig5p14A.png and the remaining rows in OODAfig5p14B.png.  The additional OODAfig5p14C.png shows the full output of a curvdatSM analysis, for obtaining the sums of squares given in the discussion.
