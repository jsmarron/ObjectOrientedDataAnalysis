# ObjectOrientedDataAnalysis: Figures, Chapter 9
This directory contains graphics and code for reproducing figures in Chapter 9

Additional Notes:


Figure 9.1 is cropped from an early draft of the unpublished paper: 
Srivastava, A., Wu, W., Kurtek, S., Klassen, E., & Marron, J. S. (2011). Registration of functional data using Fisher-Rao metric. arXiv preprint arXiv:1103.3817.  Wei Wu put in the large amount of programming reuqired to compile it.

Figure 9.2 is created as the top row in the file OODAfig9p2A.png and the remaining rows in OODAfig9p2B.png, generated by OODAfig9p2.m. 

Figure 9.7 first appeared in the unpublished PhD diserataion of Xiaosun Lu, and later in Yu, Q., Lu, X., & Marron, J. S. (2017). Principal nested spheres for time-warped functional data analysis. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 26(1), 144-151.

Figure 9.9 is created as the top row in the file OODAfig9p9A.png and the remaining row in OODAfig9p9B.png, generated by OODAfig9p9.m. 

Figure 9.10 is created as the top row in the file OODAfig9p10A.png and the remaining rows in OODAfig9p10B.png, generated by OODAfig9p10.m. 

Figure 9.13, first appeared in the unpublished PhD diserataion of Xiaosun Lu, and later in Yu, Q., Lu, X., & Marron, J. S. (2017). Principal nested spheres for time-warped functional data analysis. Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 26(1), 144-151.
